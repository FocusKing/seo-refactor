# Seo-Refactor-Horiseon

## Description

In this project we start out by cloning the starter code, and refactoring it to meet the Acceptance Criteria. 
I added semantic values to the tags within the HTML file, so that our own site is optimized for search engines.  
Tested displays for style and functionality.

## Usage
I was able to add semantic values to the tags within the HTML file, but I also wanted to make sure that the site still functioned properly.  
Provided notes within each element to explain the changes made throughout the assignment.

## Tests

Utilized Live Server to see instant changes as I made entries into the portal.  Testing to make sure the things I input were entered correctly and that the site still operated as normal after I added the semantic values.
